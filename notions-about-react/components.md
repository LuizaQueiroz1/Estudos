# How to create components and test them

props(propriedade)
children: React.ReactNode /_pode ser uma string/numero/componente_/;

How to test the component funcionalites?
I need to access the App.tsx archive and import that contains the element with the properties and put the tag name with the first letter in Caps Lock(caixa alta) and pass the property required.

And need to export the past component to the archive index.ts
