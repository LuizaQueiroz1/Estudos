## The stages of labour and birth

### Prodromal or pre-labour
Prodromal means early signs - in this case labour - or pre labour shich is the beginning of the signs and chages that will occur in the weeks and days before my labour starts properly. This stage is about changes happening gently that will morph into early labour over time. This stage may happem days or even weeks before the actual labour.

It's very gentle, so i won't notice some or all of these changes.

Some signs or changes you may notice are:

- A heavy feeling in my pervis as my baby's head engages
- the mucus plug in my vagina passing out
- more frequent bowel movements
- lower Backache
- PMT symptoms - pre mestrual symptoms
- irritability
- Nesting' instinct - it's an natural impulse that many women feel during pragnancy, specialy in the third trimester, to organize and clean the house in preparation for the baby's arrival
- Braxton hicks contractions 

### Latent phase of Labour    

The latent stage is a term that's used to describe the very start of your labour. This phase usually happpens when you are at least 37 weeks pragnant, known as full-term.

How does labour start?
Labour start, or latent stage of labour, when your cervix become soft, short and thin ready for labour. Contactions will start to open(dilate) your cervix. 
When you have a contraction, your womb tightens and then relaxes. This will feel different to Braxton Hicks contraction, which do not tend to be painful.
Labour contraction are usually short and irregular to begin with. They will become t be more frequent, stronger and longer as the labour goes on.

During a contraction, your belly will feel hard to be touch. You may feel the urge to go to the toilet as you baby presses down on your bowel.

What is a show?
A show is the mucus that function as a plugg to prevent infection from enterim my cervix. But when labour start, this plug probably will come out. This is called your show. And you may notice it in you knickers or when you wipe after going to the toilet. 

The mucus plug looks like a sticky, jelly-like blob. It may come away in one go or in pieces. Not everyone has a show or notices they have had one.

How long dows thw latent phase of labour last?

It can last between 9 to 12 hours if this is your first labour, but it must be known that every labour differs so thre's no rule. If you've had a labour before, this phase con a little bit short, lasting around 7 to 9 hours.

The latent phase is usually the longest part of labour, but this is for good reason. You womb muscles need this time to build toward the first stage of labour.

Tips to go through early labour:

- Move around if leabour is during the day. Gentle moving, and the downward pressure of you baby, may hel cervix to open. Walk about or gentle bounce an rock on a birth ball.
- Rest and try some sleep if labour starts at night.
- Dring olenty of water and have some snacks, such as toast, biscuits or banana, to keep you energy levels topped up.
- Distract yourself with music, podcastas of the TV.

What can i do to ease the pain of early labour?

- Try any relaxation and brething techniques.
- Have a massage. Your birth partner could hepl by rybbing your back.
- Have a warm bath of shower.

How will I know when established labour has started?

Establised labour is when you cervix has dilated to more than 4cm.

Try to note how often your contractions happen and how long each one lasts.

Contact your midwife, maternity unit or labour ward if:
- You contractions are coming regular and coming at least every 5 minutes
- your waters breaks
- Your contractions are very strong, and you feel you need pain relief
- you are at all worried
