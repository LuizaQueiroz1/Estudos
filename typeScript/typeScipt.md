# Learning typescript

- Syntax
  TYpescript is a lenguage that is superset of JavaScrit, meaning that it add rules about how different kinds of values can be used.

- RUntime Behavior
  TypeScript is also a lenguage that preserve the runtime behavior of javaSCript, it means that typeScript never changes the runtime behavior of Java script code

- erases type
  Once TYpeScript compiler is done checking your code, it erases types to produce the reulting "compiled" code. It means that once your code is compiled, the resulting plain JS code has no type information.
  That also means that never changes the behavior of your program based on the types in inferred(inferido). FInally, typeScript doesn't provide any addicional runtime libraries.

  ## JS vs TS

  The truth is that I can learn javaScript without knowing javaScript, but I cannot forget that are more resources avalaible about javaScript.

**TypeScript is a JavaSCript runtime with a compile-time type checker**.
